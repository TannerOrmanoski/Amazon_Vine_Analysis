# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to use the ETL process to extract a dataset of Amazon reviews, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and then load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Then Pandas is used to detect if any bias exists toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

## Results

## Summary

There seems to be some positivity bias for reviews of the vine members. A little over half of the reviews from vine members are five-stars, while only 38.7% of the reviews of non-vine members are five-stars. If we wanted further confirmation of this, we could determine how many of the reviews were one-star for each group. We could also get the mean stars for each of the groups, or use a distribution curve.
